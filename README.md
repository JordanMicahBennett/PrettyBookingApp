a. System side (super user)

b. Driver side (cannot book appointment, can view associated students/relevant appointments to drivers)

c. Student side (can book appointment)

d. Principal side (similar to admin, can book appointments, add users and a lot more, but can't delete users)

## DESIGN DISCUSSION

The design features a layout I call "DupletMaterial design", which is typically expressed as a side bar, together with a central area accessed when each side bar item is toggled, complete with a pair or duplet of components; including a large header, and a body with controls.
