# BOOKING APP
This is a scratch written (except for flat ui css) platform that permits complex appointment booking for a driving school.

It is complete with the following sections:

a. System side (super user)
b. Driver side (cannot book appointment, can view associated students/relevant appointments to drivers)
c. Student side(can book appointment)
d. Principal side (similar to admin, can book appointments, add users and a lot more, but can't delete users)


## USER MANUAL

See the "Admin Manual" section for details.

## DESIGN DISCUSSION

The design features a layout I call the "calendar look and feel" where all content sections (the areas you see when you click tabs) are shaped like calendars;
with an upper coloured portion with huge title, and a lowe portion with fields and or other user input controls etc.
