# DESCRIPTION
This is a scratch written (except for flat ui css) platform that permits complex appointment booking for a driving school.

It is complete with the following sections:

a. System side (super user)

b. Driver side (cannot book appointment, can view associated students/relevant appointments to drivers)

c. Student side (can book appointment)

d. Principal side (similar to admin, can book appointments, add users and a lot more, but can't delete users)

## USER MANUAL

See the "Admin Manual" section for details.

## DESIGN DISCUSSION

The design features a layout I call the "calendar look and feel" where all content sections (the areas you see when you click tabs) are shaped like calendars;
with an upper coloured portion with huge title, and a lower portion with fields and or other user input controls etc.


# RUNNING THE APP (OFFLINE)

You'll have to ensure that all php files in "data/phps/" are updated with the appropriate connection details for your oline server.
